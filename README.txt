Installation
-------------

Installation follows the same steps as plac. If you are lazy, just perform

::

 $ easy_install -U plac_ini

which will install the module on your system (and possibly argparse
too, if it is not already installed). Notice that Python 3 requires
the easy_install version of the distribute_ project.

If you prefer to install the full distribution from source, including
the documentation, download the tarball_, unpack it and run

::

 $ python setup.py install

in the main directory, possibly as superuser.

.. _tarball: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/plac_ini
.. _distribute: http://packages.python.org/distribute/

Testing

Still working on tests!
